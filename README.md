TESTING ARRAY METHODS

This repository is a collection of exercises assigned by Gordon Zhu in his programming course watchandcode.com

The assignment involves recreating array methods and testing them using either the tinytest.js library
or the simpletest.js library which is just Gordon's modification of the tinytest.js library for easier 
readability. 

PROCESS:

    - Create requirements from the docs on each method
    - Write a test for each requirement
    - Write only the code that's required to pass the test before continuing to next test

Special thanks to Gordon Zhu for being an amazing teacher!
