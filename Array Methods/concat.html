//merges 2 or more arrays.
//doesn't change existing arrays, creates new array.

//Syntax: var new_array = old_array.concat([value1[, value2[, ...[, valueN]]]])
//optional valueN: Arrays and/or values to concatenate into new array.
//Return value: a new array instance.

//Requirements:
//It should create a new array.
//The new array should consist of the elements in the object on which it's called.
//The new array should also include the elements of each argument if the argument is an array.
//The new array should also include the argument itself if the argument is not an array.
//It should not recurse into nested array arguments.
//The order of the new array should start with the elemements of the array it's called on and followed by the elements of each argument
    //or the argument itself it it's not an array.
//It should not alter this or any of the arrays provided as arguments. 
//It should return a shallow copy that contains copies of the same elements combined from the original arrays.
//Elements of the original array should be copied as object references and not as the actual object.
//Both the original array and the new array should refer to the same object. 
//It should copy the value of strings and booleans into the new array.
